                        <p class="description">
                            At the moment, my goal is to change the field of activity, I have been at my current place of work for 6 years. I believe that I was able to achieve everything that I could in this job, so I want to realize myself in a more promising and interesting direction. During my work, I have established myself as a responsible and executive employee who is able to fulfill the tasks assigned to me. I have no commercial experience in programming, but I strive to learn everything new and interesting for myself. In August I finished courses on Front-end development from the computer academy “ItStep”.
